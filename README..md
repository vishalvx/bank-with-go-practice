# Go Backend Practice Project

This repository contains a personal practice project focused on learning and mastering Go (Golang). The project involves designing, developing, and deploying a complete backend system using various technologies.

## Description

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with backend development and deployment processes. The key technologies and concepts covered in this project include:

- **Golang**: The primary programming language used for backend development.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database management system for storing and managing data.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and its dependencies to ensure consistent environments.
- **gRPC**: A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework.
- **Kubernetes**: For automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Features

- Backend service developed in Golang
- PostgreSQL integration for data storage
- Dockerized application for consistent and portable deployment
- gRPC for communication between microservices
- Kubernetes for orchestration and management
